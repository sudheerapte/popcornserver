Installing popcorn

1. Make sure you have NodeJS 8.10 LTS or newer on your PATH, i.e., you
can run "node -v" directly from the command line and it prints a
version number like "v8.10.0".

2. Untar the file popcorn-0.0.1.tar.gz in some directory and 'cd' into
the "server" directory inside it.

3. Execute this command:

node ./launch.js

This should start a web server listening on port 8000. You can connect
to a demo machine by typing in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/demo

It should show the word "demo" in the title bar, and a blank page.

4. Tell popcorn where to find your machine:

On launch, popcorn reads the file "options.json" in the same directory
(named "server"). The file provides the locations of all the popcorn
machines known to it. You can see the format and monkey-see, monkey-do
a similar entry for your machine.
